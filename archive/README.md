# Archive

This directory archives older versions of Singularity container 
definition files that were created as part of the naked-singularity 
project. It also stores one of the copies of the original 
naked-singularity.sh helper script. Neither the original helper script, 
nor the definitions files stored within this directory will be updated 
again. As such, they should not be used as part of any production 
workloads moving forward, unless absolutely necessary. They are stored 
here simply to serve as a historical reference.
